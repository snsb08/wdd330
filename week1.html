      <h1>Notes for Week 1:</h1>
      <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>
      <p>
        -<strong>Think before you act.</strong> What do the customer want? If I
        do not have the knowledge, where can I find it? There is no replacement
        for experience.
        <br />
        -<strong>Design.</strong> Planning is vital to software development. How
        can you create an application if you have not yet decided what it is
        going to do, what it will look like, and how it will interact with other
        pieces of software or hardware? <br />-<strong>Test</strong> If you do
        not know how to test, then you have not sufficiently completed step 1, 2
        or maybe both. Go back! <br />-<strong>Create.</strong> Begin building,
        make modifications and try again. Revise steps 1-3 if needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Section 3: Remembering User's Info</h3>
      <p>
        Communication between the user and the app or website needs to be mutual
        to be true communication. We use Input and output for that. <br />
        Variables are like label boxes in a kitchen. To be efficient, things
        need to be in the right container with the right name.
      </p>
      <h2>Master Mobile UX Videos:</h2>
      <p>
        Do Mobile first! (when the project is not specifically going to be used
        for desktop). A responsive website does not mean that you made the
        mobile first. Mobile first give better experience across many devices.
        Start small and scale up, this addresses constraints of mobile size/
        bandwidth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reachability matters. Make people's hands able to reach what they need
        most easily by respecting the areas of the phone that are reachable to
        the fingers holding a device. The bottom of the page is easier to reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speed matters. People want websites that are easy to use, fast,
        effective. A web developer's computer could be fast but most peoples'
        are probably slower. Remove unused code and minimize CSS and JS files.
        Use image optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be empathetic to user's needs when they use your website. Not everyone
        is technological savvy so make things easy and simple to understand. If
        people like your app, they will be more loyal to it instead of looking
        for another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make forms as simple as possible. If a lot of info is needed, do
        pagination on the form. You could use Float labels! Credit card
        information can be done in one single line. Make phone numbers clickable
        to call instead of text only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pay attention on the way people respond to technology. Do not use
        pop-ups/pop-overs (true, I skip websites like that myself). If adds are
        needed, make them as unobtrusive as possible. I like the add underneath
        the content peeking through a small window. How did they do that? I want
        to learn that.
