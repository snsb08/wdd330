      <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 2 Programming Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Comments are essential for others to understand your code. It can also
        help you understand your own code after a few weeks. (It is something I
        need to work on)
      </p>
      <p>Two ways to comment:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        // Single line short comment <br /><br />

        /* Multi-line comment <br />
        That can keep going <br />
        Until you close with */<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        "JavaScript is made of a series of statements." <br />
        "A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside
        curly braces"
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reserved Words:</strong><br />
        abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const,
        continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export,
        extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if,
        implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native,
        new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static,
        super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try,
        typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
        <br />Plus: undefined, NaN, Infinity <br />
        Reserved words cannot be used to name variables because they are used by
        the language in some other way.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Seven Data Types:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Symbol</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Null</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Typeof</strong> are special operators for finding out the type
        of a value:
      </p>
      <p class="expressions">
        typeof 'hello' <br />
        << 'string' <br /><br />

        typeof 10 <br />
        << 'number'<br /><br />

        typeof true<br />
        << 'boolean'<br /><br />

        typeof { ninja: 'turtle' }<br />
        << 'object'<br /><br />

        typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]<br />
        << 'object' (All non-primitive data types return a type of 'object'.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To see the value of a variable, simply enter it in the console and press
        enter. <br />
        Multiple variables can be assigned at the same time if they are
        separated by commas:
      </p>
      <p class="expressions">let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;</p>
      <p><strong>Scope:</strong> where the variable is visible</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Scope:</strong> variable declared outside of a block
          which is accessible everywhere in the program. Needs to be kept at
          minimum specially in long codes or when working on a team. (global do
          not use "let" or "const")
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Scope:</strong> variable declared inside of a block
          using "let" or "const" which is not accessible outside of that block.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Non-primitive values: they are assigned by reference, so any changes
        will affect all references to that object.
      </p>
      <p class="expressions">
        const c = { value: 1 }; <br />
        let d = c; // c.value = 1, d.value = 1 <br />
        d.value = 2; // c.value = 2, d.value = 2
      </p>
      <p>
        In the example above, the change to the value property of d also results
        in the value property of c changing as well. This is because the
        variables c and d are both referencing the same object, so any changes
        to one of them will also affect the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Backlashes</strong> are used to escape special characters in
        strings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single quote marks \'</li>
        <li>Double quote marks \"</li>
        <li>End of line \n</li>
        <li>Carriage return \r</li>
        <li>Tab \t</li>
        <li>Backslash also needs another backslash \\</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you want to know which character is at a certain position, you can
        use the charAt() method.

      <p class="questions">Question: What are symbols used for?</p>
      <p>(Review Number methods chapter when needed)</p>
      <p>NAN = Not a Number</p>
      <p>Best way to change string to a number:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        Number('23'); <br />
        << 23
      </p>
      <p>Best way to change number to a string:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        String(3); <br />
        << '3'
      </p>
      <p>To use a number and ignore any letters that come afterwards:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        const address = '221B Baker Street';<br />
        parseInt(address, 10)<br />
        << 221
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Falsy Values-</strong> 9 values that are always false in
        Boolean:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"" // double quoted empty string literal</li>
        <li>'' // single quoted empty string literal</li>
        <li>`` // empty template literal</li>
        <li>0</li>
        <li>-0 // considered different to 0 by JavaScript!</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
        <li>false</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Try to avoid Type coercion.</p>
      <p>Number.isNaN() is used to check if a value is NaN.</p>
      <p>
        Always use hard equality (===) when testing if two values are equal
        instead of using the soft equality (==). <br />
        Always use hard inequality (!==) for a more reliable result when
        checking that two values are not equal.
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 3 Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays = [] <br />
        When removing a value from an array using "delete", the space that value
        occupied is still there as "undefined". The array still has the same
        number of elements. If you want to remove it completely use the splice()
        method with a length of 1 and without specifying any values to add.
      </p>
      <p>
        Splice() can insert or remove values from an array permanently. <br />
        <strong class="expressions"
          >ArrayName.splice(index#, lengthRemoved, 'value');</strong
        >
        <br />

        Slice() creates a subarray to display just a slice of the original
        array. <br />

        Sort() is done alphabetically even the numbers are sorted by digit
        rather than numerically:
        <strong class="expressions">[10, 5, 9].</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        Questions: what are the differences between array and sets? Are sets
        what we use in JSON?
      </p>
      <p>
        To see the values of an array without duplicates, convert the array to a
        set. <br />
        Sets don't show duplicates of items or even characters. <br /><br />

        Maps are similar to 'dictionaries' in other programming languages. Maps
        can use any data type as a key.
      </p>
      <p class="expressions">
        if (condition) { <br />
        // code to run if condition is true <br />
        } else { <br />
        // code to run if condition is false <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ternary Operators:</strong> shorthand of if/else statement. Just
        be careful using it as it may make the code harder to read. <br />
        <strong class="expressions">
          condition ? (//code to run if condition is true) : (//code to run if
          condition is false)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        const n = 5; <br />
        n%2 === 0 ? console.log('n is an even number') : console.log('n is an
        odd number'); <br />
        << 'n is an odd number'
      </p>
      <p>Shorter using template string:</p>
      <p class="expressions">
        console.log(`n is a ${(n%2 === 0)? 'even' : 'odd'} number`);
      </p>
      <p><strong>Switch:</strong></p>
      <p>
        if (number === 4) { <br />
        console.log('You rolled a four'); <br />
        } else if (number === 5) { <br />
        console.log('You rolled a five'); <br />
        } else if(number === 6){ <br />
        console.log('You rolled a six'); <br />
        } else { <br />
        console.log('You rolled a number less than four'); <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Switch: <br />
        <strong class="expressions"
          >switch (number) { <br />
          case 4: <br />
          console.log('You rolled a four'); <br />
          break; <br />
          case 5: <br />
          console.log('You rolled a five'); <br />
          break; <br />
          case 6: <br />
          console.log('You rolled a six'); <br />
          break; <br />
          default: <br />
          console.log('You rolled a number less than four'); <br />
          break; <br />
          }
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Always finish a case block with a break. <br />

        Default keyword= code if none of the other cases are true.
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 4 Functions</h3>
      <p><strong>Functions</strong> are like mini programs.</p>
      <p>
        Be consistent on your style of writing functions declarations or
        expressions. <br />

        Remember DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself <br />

        Always put default parameters after all the other parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arrow Functions:</strong> Are always anonymous, so if you want
        to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable. They work better
        for short, anonymous functions. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Function Hoisting:</strong> Function declarations are
        automatically hoisted so they can be used before being defined. Function
        expressions can only be used after being defined not before.
