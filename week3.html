      <h3>Chapter 5 Objects</h3>
      <p>
        Objects are like a database of values or a dictionary. <br />

        Objects are assigned by reference. If two variables reference the same
        object, they will both change when one is modified. <br />
        JSON is both human and machine readable.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Property names must be double-quoted</li>
        <li>
          Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false,
          null, arrays and objects
        </li>
        <li>Functions are not permitted values</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Rounding Methods</strong></p>
      <p>
        Math.ceil() to round up <br />
        Math.floor() to round down <br />
        Math.round() to round to the nearest integer <br />
        Math.trunc() to cut the decimal point (gets truncated)
      </p>
      <p><strong>Maximum & Minimum Methods</strong></p>
      <p>
        Math.max() returns the maximum number <br />
        Math.min() returns the minimum number <br />

        Be careful with rounding numbers if the result needs to be exact because
        it is often inaccurate. Computers have lots of trouble dealing with
        decimal fractions and the results can vary depending on the web browser
        or operating system. But most of the time rounding errors are not a
        problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        To generate a random number between 0 and another number, multiply
        Math.random() by that number.

        <br />
        The Epoch is a date used in programming as a reference point in time to
        measure dates. It is 1st January 1970.
      </p>
      <p>
        RegExp = Regular expression that use a pattern to find strings. <br />

        Preferred method: Using literal notation between forward slashes: <br />

        const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/; <br />

        Alternative: Using new operator and a constructor function: <br />
        const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        Question/Comment: I wonder if people use regExp for family history
        search. Since many times names are misspelled by just one letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some string methods accept regular expressions as a parameter. <br />

        For example: <br />
        'JavaScript'.match(/[aeiou]/g); // return an array of all the vowels
        <br />
        << ['a', 'a', 'i'] <br />

        'JavaScript'.replace(/[aeiou]/ig,'*'); <br />
        << 'J*v*Scr*pt' <br />
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 6 The Document Object Model</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM is a document that has elements connected like branches and
        nodes of a plant or tree. <br />

        The DOM is not part of JavaScript. DOM can be used with any programming
        language, but JavaScript is the language most commonly used with it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Getting elements</strong></p>
      <p>
        There are different methods to access the elements of a page so they can
        be assigned to variables and be inspected or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        document.getElementById() -an element with a unique Id name. Only one
        can have that name. <br />
        document.getElementsByClassName() -multiple elements can share a class
        name. <br />
        document.querySelector() <br />
        Dot notation
      </p>
      <p>
        The attributes of an element can be modified or added using
        setAttribute. It takes two arguments: the attribute that you wish to
        change, and the new value of that attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elements can be created with createElement(). <br />

        Child elements can be modify with appendChild(), replaceChild(), or
        removeChild().
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 7 Events</h3>
      <p>
        The addEventListener() can help to add some functions that run in the
        background and let us know when they happen. They only start if the
        event argument is true and if not, the program keeps moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is better to avoid events inside the HTML code. Keep JavaScript code
        separately, out of the HTML.

        <br />
        Using the name Event makes the code more readable but it is not
        mandatory to call it Event. Many developers use the "e" for short.

        <br />
        Be careful about using a single click and double-click event in the same
        element because it can get confusing and the double-click might trigger
        the single click event too.

        <br />
        It is important to add both mouse events and touch events because of the
        variety of devices that can be used.
        <br />The swipe effect is done with a combination of touchstart and
        touchmove.
