      <h3>Chapter 8 Form</h3>
      <p>
        Traditionally, forms are processed by back end but recently front-end
        can be used to process forms using JavaScript.

        <br />
        Reset buttons can clear important information if press accidentally so
        only put in forms when it is really necessary.

        <br />
        Some common types of form control are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          'input' fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons,
          and file uploads
        </li>
        <li>'select' menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
        <li>'textarea' elements for longer text entry</li>
        <li>'button' elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chapter 12 Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Object-oriented Programming separates the code into objects that have
        properties and methods.
      </p>
      <p>3 Main Concepts in OOP:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Encapsulation: work is kept hidden from user except for essetial
          functionalities
        </li>
        <li>
          Polymorphism: different objects can share the same method, but have
          different implementations
        </li>
        <li>
          Inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new
          features.
        </li>
      </ul>
