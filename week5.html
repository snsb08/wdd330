      <h3>Chapter 11 Testing and Debugging</h3>
      <p>
        Testing and Debugging is important for programmers because there is
        always a possible error or bug in a program. A programmer needs to
        constantly be looking for possible error and find ways to minimized
        them.
      </p>
      <p>Possible causes of errors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          System error: the program is used in a system or device that is having
          problems. It is not the programmer's fault but by being aware of
          possible common system errors, problems can be reduced.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmer error: a typo can cause incorrect syntax or faulty logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          User error: typing incorrect type of data can cause a problem.
          Programmers cannot control what the user will do but they can imagine
          ahead of time different possible user errors and make the program in a
          way that minimizes them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is better to know when an error occurs to be able to fix it, so
        programs must have alerts for error and warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        'use strict'; Mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits
        the use of some deprecated features.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        Questions: why or how do deprecated features happen? I did have a code
        before that said that the variable was deprecated but it still allowed
        me to use it, possibly because I did not have the strict mode, but I did
        not understand why it was deprecated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recommended way to invoke strict mode: (function() { <br />
        'use strict'; <br /><br />

        // All your code would go inside this function <br /><br />

        }());
      </p>
      <h4>Feature Detection</h4>
      <p>
        It is impossible to know which browser will be used by each user, so the
        program has to find a way to be compatible and it can be done using
        feature detection. We can use an if statement that will prevent errors
        if certain methods are not supported by the browser being used. "Feature
        detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually
        exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being thrown, if the
        method doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <h4>Debugging in the Browser</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>The Trusty alert() method</strong> can be used to debug a
        program by acting like breakpoint since the program stops until the ok
        is clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the
        console. This will show functions that were called in the lead up to an
        exception occurring while the code is running.
      </p>
      <h4>Debugging tools</h4>
      <p>
        Most modern browsers have a debugging tool that sets breakpoints to
        check the code.
      </p>
      <h4>Error Objects</h4>
      <p>
        An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception
        occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.
        <br />
        const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');
      </p>
      <p>There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only
          retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors
          when using the global eval() function.
        </li>
        <li>
          RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of
          values.
        </li>
        <li>
          ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that
          doesn&apos;t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been
          defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          SyntaxError is thrown when there&apos;s an error in the code’s syntax.
        </li>
        <li>
          TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used;
          for example, a string is used when a number is expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the
          URI.
        </li>
        <li>
          InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error
          occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much
          recursion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All error objects have a number of properties, but they’re often used
        inconsistently across browsers. The only properties that are generally
        safe to use are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The name property returns the name of the error constructor function
          used as a string, such as 'Error' or 'ReferenceError'.
        </li>
        <li>
          The message property returns a description of the error and should be
          provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stack property will return a stack trace for that error. This is a
          non-standard property and it’s recommended that it is not safe to use
          in production sites.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Throwing Exceptions</h4>
      <p>
        The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing
        the execution of the program to stop.
      </p>
      <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Try:</strong> code in a try block will run as normal but if an
        exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a
        catch block. <strong>Catch:</strong> code in a catch block will only run
        if an exception I thrown inside the try block.
        <strong>Finally:</strong> the finally block always executed after the
        try or catch block. It is used if you want some code to run in both
        cases.
      </p>
      <h4>Tests</h4>
      <p>
        Testing helps to write better code where errors can be identified early
        on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test-driven development (TDD)</strong> is considered to be best
        practice, but many do not use it.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>Refactor the code</li>
        <li>Test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
      </ol>
