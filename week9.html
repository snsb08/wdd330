        <br />
        x = 6; // global variable created <br />
        << 6 <br /><br />
        window.x // same variable can be accessed as a property of the window
        object
        <br />
        << 6 <br /><br />
        <br />
        // both variables are exactly the same <br />

        Window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser
        is display on.

        <br /><br />
        window.screen.height <br />
        << 1024 <br /><br />
        window.screen.width
        <br />
        << 1280

        <br /><br />
        The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you
        to do things like turn off the device’s screen, detect a change in its
        orientation or lock it in a specific orientation. <br />
        Screen object works with mobile devices to turn off the device's screen
        or detect a change in its orientation or lock it in a specific
        orientation.

        <br /><br />
        setTimeout() accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and
        a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.

        <br /><br />
        setInterval() repeatedly invokes the callback function after every given
        number of milliseconds.

    <h3>Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h3>

    <p>The data- attributes  are custom attributes used for embedding data. They are private to a page and ignored by the browser. Their purpose is to be used by JavaScript only. 

       <br><br> They follow the following format:
       <ul><li>Starts with data-</li>
        <li>Contains only: lowercase, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores</li>
        <li>include an optional string value</li>
    </ul> 
        
      <br>  data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'
       <br> data-rating = '5' 
       <br> data-dropdown 
       <br> data-user = 'DAZ' 
       <br> data-max-length = '32'
        
      <br><br>  Dataset is used to access the attributes of data. The hyphens are removed and replaced by camel-case: data-max-length for dataset.maxLength 
        </p>

        <p>
            HTML5 Web Storage:
         <br>   LocalStorage.setItem  stores some information in the memory even if the browser closes
         <br>   localStorage.getItem access the information that was stored
         <br>   localStorage.removeItem to remove the item from the memory
         <br>   localStorage.clear() removes everything that was stored in local storage

         <br>   The position object has several other properties that can be used to find out information about the location and movement of the device:
         <br>   position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.
         <br>   position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.
         <br>   position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.
         <br>   position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.
